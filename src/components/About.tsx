        I am Joseph. Over the past few months, I've been building projects
        ranging from marketing websites to complex solutions and enterprise apps
        with focus on fast, elegant and accessible user experiences. Currently,
        In my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with new Web3 development tools,
        while vibing to some cool afrobeats music or playing basketball at the
        local basketball court with my teammates, I also enjoy socializing on
        twitter and speaking on twitter spaces .
